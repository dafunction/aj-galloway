Welcome to my "digital garden".   My name is Alec Galloway.  I'm a quality assurance professional and general tech enthusiast.   These "logs" serve as a public journal, detailing what I'm currently working on, learning, and various insights that I care to write about and share.

This site will likely change a bit because although I'm reasonably familiar with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), I'm quite new to [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), but I'm very excited to continue learning about it.

Aside from consuming any quality assurance tech/tools/materials, I'm most actively engaged in learning about #fabric, #whisper, and #stable-diffusion currently.
